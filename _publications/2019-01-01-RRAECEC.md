**Abstract**：Based on provincial panel data from 2002 to 2015 in China, Construction of input output index of compulsory education in the period of transformation and development, Using stochastic frontier production 
function and spatial econometrics, This paper evaluates the efficiency of compulsory education resource allocation in China from the perspective of “financial resources”, “human resources” and “material resources”. It was supported that:  (1) The output efficiency of the allocation of compulsory education resources is restrained by the expenditure per-student and the number of computers used for teaching activities, while the growth of full-time teachers is conducive to optimizing the output efficiency of resource allocation.(2) The technical efficiency of the allocation of compulsory education resources in the sample period is decreasing year by year,
which reflects the deviation between the actual output and the best possible output, while the current mode of investment in compulsory education shows that it is conducive to promoting the balanced development of compulsory education in the region. (3)The Moran's I, Geary's, Getis & Ord's G show that compulsory education investment has strong spatial auto-correlation in the whole world, while the local distribution shows non-balanced distribution.
Spatial convergence enlarges the inhibiting effect of per-student educational expenditure as well as computer number on spatial allocation efficiency in adjacent provinces. On this basis, this paper further discusses the new era,the new era of the quality of compulsory education development in the dialectical relationship between fairness and efficiency. <br>
