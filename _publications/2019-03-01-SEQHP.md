**Abstract**：Beijing started the comprehensive reform of compulsory education in early 2014, aiming to balance the distribution of compulsory education resources. In order to study the contribution of school education quality to housing price inequality and its changes in a certain period of time before and after the comprehensive reform of compulsory education, this paper adopts the second-hand housing transaction price data of Beijing from 2013 to 2016,uses Sharpley decomposition method based on regression equation, and divides the grade of school districts into city key, district key and general districts. The results show that:(1) education can explain about 20% of the housing price inequality;(2) the contribution of education quality to housing price inequality has changed significantly before and after the comprehensive education reform in 2014;(3) compared with the district key, the city key contributes more to housing price inequality. <br>
