**Abstract**：This paper uses the data of multiple tracking surveys of 
students in a university in Jiangsu Province, and uses Propensity Score 
Matching to explore the differences in academic performance and extracurricular performance between the holistic evaluation students and the general enrollment students after entering the university, as well as the characteristics of such differences with the increase of the time studying at the university. The study found that male students, urban students, students whose parents have higher levels of education, and students with lower scores in the college entrance examination are more likely to enroll through holistic evaluation. After entering the university, the holistic evaluation students’ academic performance and extracurricular performance are better than those of general students, but this advantage will weaken with the increase of time studying at the university. Heterogeneity analysis found that the differences in academic performance and extracurricular performance between holistic evaluation students and general enrollment students were more prominent among rural students. Based on this, universities should establish rural special plans, strengthen the cultivation of students’ personalities through holistic evaluation, and focus on tracking evaluation to build an integrated mechanism from selection, training to tracking, and promote the cultivation of more innovative talents with comprehensive development. <br>
