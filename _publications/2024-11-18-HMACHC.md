**Abstract**：As the core concept of macroeconomic research, the accurate measurement of human capital is the advance of macroeconomic research, and having a full understanding of the indicators and data to measure human capital is also an important basis for scholars to conduct related research. In order to deepen the understanding of the existing human capital measurement indicators and data, this paper introduces the current commonly used human capital measurement indicators, as well as the existing problems, and data construction principles and methods , along the "evolution history" of human capital measurement indicators, which mainly include years of education, students' cognitive skills, quality-adjusted years of schooling, adult cognitive skills, and education quality and human capital separated from market wage information. Based on the unified framework provided by the theory of human capital and the theory of educational production function, this paper introduces the classification and characteristics of each measurement, and puts forward five basic principles for judging the advantages and disadvantages of human capital measurement, namely, "comprehensive measurement is better than single- dimension measurement", "direct measurement is better than indirect measurement", "stock measurement is better than flow measurement", "output measurement is better than input measurement" and "quality measurement is better than quantity measurement". Finally, this paper summarizes the overall development law of human capital measurement indicators, the limitations of evaluation indicators and data, and finally looks forward to the future development direction of human capital research.<br>
